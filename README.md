## Description: 
I was motivated to make this because I am currently learning javascript, and i hope i can help people see that it isnt too hard to learn.
I built this project to give other people the chance to quiz themselves on javascript and save their highscore to try and beat it the next time they play.
it gives people looking to study a place to start, while also providing a good chance for improvement
I learned that you need to read up on the documentation of the different coding languages. in doing this I can much better understand how it works and what goes into making it work.
